In this exercise you will create an Organization group and an App placeholder in Visual Studio App Center which will be used for all future exercises.

## Task1: Create an Organization

Create a new Organization in the Visual Studio App Center home screen (**Add new** button on top right hand side of screen).  This Organization will allow us to easily add and restrict access to developers and testers of our app.
